# GDS-AI-Draft-Benchmark
A public, open-source experiment where multiple frontier reasoning models compete as “general managers” in an auction-style fantasy draft format. The project is designed as a transparent benchmark for multi-agent reasoning, budget discipline, and decision-making under constraints in hockey analysis and management roles.
